In the above screen shot, the image and search bar are net to each other on the same line but the paragraphs are aligned one by one. This is due to display properties in CSS.

## Types of elements in HTML

There are 3 types of elemnts in HTML

### Block elements

Block elements takes up the entire line, `paragraph` is by default a block element.

### Inline-block elements

> This elements only takes up as much space as needed, as the result another element could appear beside them.

For example we see the `image` and `search bar` are next to each other because they donot occupy the entire line.

### Inline-elements:

Inline elements are basically text elements. They appear within a line of text <strong></strong> comes under inline elemnts.

## change block elemets(paragraphs) to inline-block elements

Adjusting/placing 2 paragraphs next to each other is not possible as they are block elements and occupy the entire line.

However, they can be converted into `Inline-block elements` using below css property

```java
.video-author,
.video-stats {
  display: inline-block;
}
```
