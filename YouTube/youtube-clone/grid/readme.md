Grid is basically devided into rows and columns, imagine columns and rows similar to Swing assuming X and Y axis.

To create Grid we need two properties 

```java
.main-div{
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 100px 100px;
    // In the above step we defined how many columsn do we need and width of them.
}
```
